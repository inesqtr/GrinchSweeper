## `The Grinchsweeper`

---

2 days individual hackathon: Building a Christmas themed game. Used React Native for the first time (itâ€™s
not part of the WCS program) to build a minesweeper game. Got awarded, by my colleagues and tutors,
with a Best Tech Skills title.

#### *Goal:*

1. Create a Windows 95 look

2. Create modal with game instructions

3. Randomizing mines placement on the array

4. Write function to: show grid, reveal the neighbours (mines and empty cells), click on cell and show
neighbours, reset the game, reveal all cells when losing/winning

5. Create win/lose logic - give a feedback to the user when he wins or loses

6. Give the possibility to start a new game, at any time


#### *Technologies:*

1. React Native

2. JavaScript

3. Expo
